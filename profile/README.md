## HMPL Language

🌐 hmpl is a small template language for displaying UI from server to client. It is based on _customizable_ requests sent to the server via [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) and processed into ready-made HTML. Reduce the size of your javascript files and display the same UI as if it was written in a modern framework.
